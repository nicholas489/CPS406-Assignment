# Dance Club Management App README

## Project Overview

This project aims to create a comprehensive management system for a small amateur club, such as a salsa dancing club. The club has a membership of a couple of dozen individuals who meet weekly for practice sessions under the guidance of an amateur coach. Members have the flexibility to attend these sessions as per their convenience and are required to pay a participation fee for each session they attend. This application serves to streamline the financial and operational aspects of running the club, ensuring smooth transactions and communication between the members and the administration.

### Key Features

- **Attendance and Payment Tracking**: Monitors member attendance at practice sessions and manages payment records, including options for advance payments with potential discounts.
- **Financial Management**: Handles the club's finances, ensuring the coach and rent for the hall are paid timely. Provides insights into the financial health of the club.
- **Reminder System**: Sends out reminders to members for upcoming practice sessions, and nudges those who have pending payments.
- **Flexibility and Engagement**: Encourages member participation by offering a flexible attendance model while maintaining financial accountability.

## Deliverables

### A. Product Backlog

The Product Backlog is a dynamic document that lists all the features, functionalities, and fixes required for the project, prioritized based on their value to the club. It includes:

- **User Stories/Tasks**: Each item is clearly defined to ensure all team members understand the requirements.
- **Effort Estimates**: Every story/task is assigned an estimated effort level, facilitating sprint planning and resource allocation.
- **Actual Effort**: Post-completion, the actual effort expended on each story/task is recorded to enhance future estimation accuracy.
- **Team Velocity Diagram**: Illustrates the team's productivity over time, aiding in the prediction of future sprint capacities.

### B. Test Plan

Scheduled for the end of iteration 3, the test plan outlines the approach to validate the application's functionality and reliability. It includes:

- **Test Conditions**: Detailed scenarios under which the software's features and operations will be examined.
- **Test Inputs**: Specific data and parameters used in testing to simulate various usage conditions.
- **Expected Outputs**: The anticipated results for each test, ensuring the application meets all requirements and behaves as intended.
